                        Fantasy cricket is a fantasy sports game where each player can make a team of 11 players. As the game starts, the users get points for the fantasy teams they have selected based on their performance in the real match. The points are given on the basis of runs, wickets and catches, among others.
                
                        To join a fantasy cricket league, you need to join a match and pick a fantasy team of 11 players that includes 1-6 batsmen, 1-6 bowlers, 1-4 wicket-keepers and 1-6 all-rounders. Along with it, you also need to select the Captain and Vice-Captain of the team.
                        
                        But what truly makes online fantasy cricket so interesting? Well, there is more than one reason for it.
                        
                        Create your team: Fantasy sports put you in control. You make your own cricket team 11 and then enjoy seeing them win a match. So, you can actually leave behind the frustrating feeling of watching a team play that you didn't agree to.</p>

                        Research and stay up-to-date: Before creating your fantasy cricket team, research the players' form, their performance in recent matches, and their record in specific conditions. Stay updated with the latest team news, injuries, and any changes in the squad.

                        Analyze the pitch and weather conditions: Pitch and weather conditions play a significant role in cricket, so it's important to analyze them before selecting your team. Check the weather forecast for the match day, and determine whether the pitch is likely to assist spin or pace bowlers.
                        
                        Consider the player's role: Analyze the role of the player in the team. For example, a top-order batsman is likely to get more chances to score runs compared to a lower-order batsman, and a fast bowler is more likely to take wickets compared to a spinner.
                        
                        Balance your team:
                        
                        
                        </p>
